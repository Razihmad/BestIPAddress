# BestIPAddress
This project is completely created on django framework. The main purpose of this project is to get the best IP Address on the basis of fraud score of IP in the selected city of USA.
To achieve this first we connect to that IP by urllib python library and then using the request library we access the API of a website which gives the fraud score of the IP to which you are conneted to.
